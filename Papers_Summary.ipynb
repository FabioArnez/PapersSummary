    "1. __Runtime Verification__:\n",
    "    - Runtime verification is the discipline of computer science that deals with the study, development, and application of those verification techniques that allow checking whether a run of a system under scrutiny satisfies or violates a given correctness property.\n",
    "    - Deals (only) with detection of violations (or satisfactions) of correcteness properties. Thus, whenevere a vilation has been observed, usually it does not influence or change the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __A Run of a System__:\n",
    "    -  Understood as a possibly infinite sequence of the system's states\n",
    "    - Formally, a run may be considered as a possible infinite word otr trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __An Execution of a System__:\n",
    "    - Is a finite prefix of a run and formally it is a finite trace.\n",
    "    - When running a program we can only observe executions, which however restrict the corresponding evolving run as being in their prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Monitors__:\n",
    "    - Is a device that reads a finite trace and yields a certain veredict\n",
    "    - Checks whether an executions meets a correctness property\n",
    "    - Decides whether the current execution satisfies a given correctness property by outputting yes/true or no/false\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Model Checking__:\n",
    "    - Model checking describes the problem of determining whether a given model $M$ and correctness property $\\phi$, all computations of $M$ satisfy $\\phi$.\n",
    "    - Automatic verificaiton technique\n",
    "    - Usually for finite state systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Runtime Verification__:\n",
    "    - Has its origins in model checking\n",
    "    - Differences with model checking:\n",
    "        - In model Checking all executions of a given system are examined to answer  whether they satisfy a given correctness property $\\phi$\n",
    "        - While model checking typically considers infinite traces, runtime verification deals with finite executions—as execu tions have necessarily to be finite\n",
    "        - While in model checking a complete model is given allowing to consider arbitrary positions of a trace, runtime verification, especially when dealing with online monitoring, considers finite executions of increasing size. For this, a monitor should be designed to consider executions in an incremental fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - __Runtime verification deals only with observed executions as they are generated by the real system.__\n",
    "    - __Thus runtime verification is applicable to black box systems for whichnosystemmodelis at hand.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __When to Use Runtime Verification__:\n",
    "    - The verification verdict, as obtained by model checking or theorem proving, is often referring to a model of the real system under analysis, since applying these techniques __directly to the real implementation would be intractable.__\n",
    "    - Runtime verification may then be used to easily check the actual execution of he system, to make sure that the implementation really meets its correctness properties.\n",
    "    - Some information is available only at runtime or is conveniently checked at runtime\n",
    "    - The behavior of an application may depend heavily on the environment of the target system, but a precise description of this environment might not exist.\n",
    "    - In the case of safety-critical systems, it is useful also to monitor behavior or properties that have been statically proved or tested, mainly to have a double check that everything goes well:\n",
    "        - Here, runtime verification acts as a partner of theorem proving, model checking and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The above mentioned items can be found in a combined manner especially in highly dynamic systems such as adaptive, self-organizing, or self-healing systems."
